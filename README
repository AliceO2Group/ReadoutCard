RORC module


## Authors: 
 - Tuan Mate Nguyen (C layer)
 - Pascal Boeschoten (C++ interface)


## Dependencies
The RORC module depends on the PDA (Portable Driver Architecture) library. 
If PDA is not detected on the system, only a dummy implementation of the interface will be compiled.

#### PDA installation procedure
1. Install libpci dependency
  # yum install pciutils-devel

2. Download & extract PDA 11.0.7
  $ wget https://compeng.uni-frankfurt.de/fileadmin/Images/pda/pda-11.0.7.tar.gz
  $ tar zxvf pda-11.0.7.tar.gz
  $ cd pda-11.0.7

3. Compile
  $ ./configure --debug=true --numa=true --modprobe=true
  $ make
  # make install


## System configuration
When using shared memory allocations for the DMA buffer, it is highly recommended to configure hugepage support on the system.
Without hugepages, scatter-gather lists may be highly fragmented. 
In addition, with larger RORC page sizes (> 4 KB), the driver may have difficulty finding enough contiguous memory to use for RORC pages.
For more information about hugepages: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt

### Hugepages configuration steps:
1. Install hugetlbfs (will already be installed on most systems)
  # yum install libhugetlbfs

2. Allocate hugepages
  # echo [number] > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
  Where [number] is enough to cover the DMA buffer needs.
  By default, hugepages are 2 MB. 

3. Check to see if they're actually available
  # cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge
  'HugePages_Total' should correspond to [number]

4. Mount hugetlbfs
  # mkdir /mnt/hugetlbfs (if directory does not exist)
  # mount --types hugetlbfs none /mnt/hugetlbfs -o pagesize=2M
