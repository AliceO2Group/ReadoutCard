RORC module


## Authors: 
 - Tuan Mate Nguyen (C layer)
 - Pascal Boeschoten (C++ interface)


## Dependencies
The RORC module depends on the PDA (Portable Driver Architecture) library. 
For installation instructions, see [insert link to Tuan's documentation here].
If PDA is not detected on the system, only a dummy implementation of the interface will be compiled.


## System configuration
When using shared memory allocations for the DMA buffer, it is highly recommended to configure hugepage support on the system.
Without hugepages, scatter-gather lists may be highly fragmented. 
In addition, with larger RORC page sizes (> 4 KB), the driver may have difficulty finding enough contiguous memory to use for RORC pages.
For more information about hugepages: https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt

Configuration steps:

1. Install hugetlbfs (will already be installed on most systems)
  # yum install libhugetlbfs

2. Allocate hugepages
  # echo [number] > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
  Where [number] is enough to cover the DMA buffer needs.
  By default, hugepages are 2 MB. 

3. Check to see if they're actually available
  # cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge
  'HugePages_Total' should correspond to [number]

4. Mount hugetlbfs
  # mkdir /mnt/hugetlbfs (if directory does not exist)
  # mount --types hugetlbfs none /mnt/hugetlbfs -o pagesize=2M
